# Hello, I'm Aysan 👋

Welcome to my personal portfolio! I'm a **front-end developer** with a passion for creating **beautiful** and **user-friendly** websites and applications. I specialize in **React** and **Tailwind CSS**, and I strive to build responsive, efficient, and scalable solutions.

Over the years, I've honed my skills in modern web technologies and have worked on small personal sites. I’m always looking for new opportunities to learn and grow in the ever-evolving world of web development.

## 🌟 My Skills:

- **React.js**: Building interactive user interfaces.
- **Tailwind CSS**: Rapidly building custom designs.
- **JavaScript**: Writing clean and efficient code.
- **HTML/CSS**: Structuring and styling web pages.
- **Git/GitHub**: Version control and collaboration.
- **Responsive Design**: Ensuring web apps look great on any device.

## 💼 Notable Works:
